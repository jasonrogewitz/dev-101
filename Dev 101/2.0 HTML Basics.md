I suggest students open a new Codepen instance and follow along with parts of the tutorial: https://codepen.io/pen

Absolute beginners introduction to HTML: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONin3xInlGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONin3xInlGw) (50min)

> "If you want to learn web design, but you've never written a line of code in your life, then start here." 

I like this because it starts from absolute zero and describes HTML basics in a pretty reasonably thorough manner. Students can follow along and from here, will have the ability to create and view their own HTML page locally (on their computer). It covers all of the following topics, and we can use these links as supplementary sources.

## 2.1 Create your first webpage: 
Video with deeper walkthrough of tags/properties and VSCode live server setup. I think the focus on properties and attributes is important. This video has accompanying text post. 

Students should follow along on their own machines and create a webpage. You may copy the page in the video, or create your own.

-   Classes/IDs 
-   Advanced HTML Tags


## 2.2 Inspecting HTML/CSS: [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-inspecting-html-and-css](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-inspecting-html-and-css)

I think this is a good (quick) overview of what the inspector is, why it's useful, and how to start using it



## 2.3 Intermediate HTML concepts

HTML Basics in VSCode: 

-   Watch this video and follow along in VSCode: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE) (60 min)

This video re-introduces some concepts, then uses all of the previously-learned knowledge and adds more tags, shows practical uses for the inspector. It could be used in place of all of the above HTML knowledge but I think it works better as a suppliment.

Topics:

- Forms and different input types
- HTML5 tags like header, nav, article, 
- CSS in HTML
- JS in HTML
- Inspector

## 2.4 Resources: Where to find help:

-  MDN Web Docs is a documentation repository and learning resource for web developers. It was started by Mozilla as a unified place for documentation about open web standards and developer guides.  [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

-  W3Schools is _a school for web developers_, covering all the aspects of web development [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)

-   A front-end developer turned blogger writes about common HTML/CSS problems and solutions. Also creator of CodePen. [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)

-  Not all HTML/CSS/JS features are created equal. Certain features (Ex: CSS content-queries) may not be available in certain browsers or devices and therefore will only be seen by a fraction of users to your website. You can see browser support for all features using [https://caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com)

-  StackOverflow is the #1 place to ask programming questions and find answers for common programming knowledge. Remember to do proper research beforehand and include any additional information with your question. Ask your question in the appropriate category: [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com)

## 2.5 PROJECT

Students should now know how to use their IDE, command-line and version control basics, and have the ability to create and view webpages.

Use Git to create a new repository. Use HTML to create a static webpage:
Create your own digital business card or contact card with your name (or nickname), a job title ("awesome web dev!"), and some way to contact you.

**Bonus:** Include an Image/Avatar

#### Helpful information
-   `git add .`
-   Adds all of the files in the current directory `.` to git tracking in order to be committed.

-   `git commit -am “Commit message for git history”`
-   Commits -a (all) of the currently staged/tracked files with the -m (message) “Commit message for git history”
